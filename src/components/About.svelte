    <h1>Welcome to ByteBoard</h1>
    <p>This is a programming / tech related forum I built for fun. There are lots of features. You can post under different topics, you can message other users, you can comment on posts, you will be notified upon login about
    things such as comment replies or new comments on your posts.</p>
    <p>
        You can like and dislike posts and comments. This will not affect the visibility of anything but it can be a way for other users to know whether a comment or post is generally seen as helpful. The auto-encrypt
        feature allows you to upload a PGP public key and whenever you receive DMs on this platform, they will be automatically encrypted using your uploaded public key. Otherwise private messages will be stored in plaintext.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are talking about anything sensitive in private messages I highly suggest uploading a public key and turning auto encrypt on. You can go to any users profile and check if they have it on themselves,
        if they don't and you wish for them to turn it on you can reach out to them and ask them to do so. Turning on auto-encrypt only encrypts incoming messages not outgoing messages if the recipient does not have
        encryption set up on their account.
